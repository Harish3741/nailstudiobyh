## Design Language

Match the aesthetic of the Instagram page — moody, minimal, luxe.

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Background | `#faf7f4` (warm cream) |
| Surface | `#f5ede8` / `#ede0da` |
| Rose accent | `#c07878` / `#d9a8a8` |
| Nude accent | `#c4a48e` |
| Text | `#2a1a18` (deep warm charcoal) |
| Text muted | `#7a6860` |
| Border | `rgba(192, 120, 120, 0.2)` |
| Heading font | Cormorant Garamond (serif, light/italic) |
| Body font | Poppins (sans-serif, 300–500) |
| Border radius | 12px |

**Aesthetic principles:**
- Light, airy cream backgrounds with blush/rose and nude accents
- Italic serif headings for elegance
- Minimal, no clutter
- Subtle animations (sparkle float, scroll fade-in, scroll-line hint)
- The logo is a CSS-rendered circle with "NAIL STUDIO / by / H" — no image logo
- Color palette matches the brand: blush pinks, warm nudes, cream/off-white

## Gallery

Gallery tiles are CSS gradient placeholders that link to real Instagram posts.
When updating gallery posts, replace the `href` on `.gallery-tile` elements and update the gradient in `.tile-N` CSS rules to loosely match the post's color palette.

Current posts (tile-1 through tile-9):
- tile-1: `/p/DVyKrfwE9ge/`
- tile-2: `/p/DVpF2jlkz6G/`
- tile-3: `/p/DVcvaCxk45x/`
- tile-4: `/p/DVX2_h1E3jy/`
- tile-5: `/p/DVSi-ZmE_Bi/`
- tile-6: `/p/DU7DOVrDx1o/`
- tile-7: `/p/DU2_jrIk64E/`
- tile-8: `/p/DU1g7mEk6B8/`
- tile-9: `/p/DUpWBXyE8oK/`

## JavaScript Behaviours

- **Navbar:** adds `.scrolled` class (frosted glass) after 30px scroll
- **Mobile nav:** hamburger toggles `.open` on nav links; closes on link click
- **Accordion:** one-open-at-a-time toggle with `aria-expanded` and `max-height` animation
- **Scroll fade-in:** `IntersectionObserver` adds `.visible` to `.fade-in` elements with staggered delay

## Deployment

Not yet decided. Site is static — compatible with GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel with zero config.

## Content Notes

- All copy and pricing should reflect what's on the Instagram page as source of truth
- Avoid making up services or prices — check Instagram if uncertain
- Tone is warm, personal, and feminine but not overly cutesy
- "H" refers to the nail tech — her full name is not published on the site
